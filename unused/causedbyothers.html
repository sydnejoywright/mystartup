      <p>We live in an imperfect world with many imbalances of power. Often, innocent people are put in harm's way by 
        the cruel or poor decisions of others. Maybe someone has  hurt you or someone you love. Maybe you have been bothered
         by cruelty you have seen in the world.Â

        In The Book of Mormon Amulek's friends are put to death because they are believers in Christ. 
        Amulek is torn apart and asks how it could be allowed to happen.
