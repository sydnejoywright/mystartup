        <h1>Alma's Story</h1>
    
        <img src="suffering_angel_appears.jpg" alt="angel appears to alma and sons of mosiah" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
        <p>"Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself.</p>
        <p>For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.</p>
        
        <p>And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.</p>
        <p>But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.</p>
        
        <p>And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.</p>
        <p>And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.</p>
        
        <p>And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God—I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.</p>
        <p>But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</p>
        
        <p>Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</p>
        <p>Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</p>
        <p>And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</p>
        
        <p>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
        <p>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>
        
        <p>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>
        <p>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!"</p>
