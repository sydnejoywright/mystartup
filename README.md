# mystartup
cs260 startup

##Elevator Pitch:
My startup will allow people who have never been exposed to the Book of Mormon to have a personal, self-guided experience in which they find answers to their pressing concerns. They will be prompted to both read and reflect on short, relevant passages that address their current needs. The goal is to let the truths speak for themselves and to organically generate interest in the Book of Mormon. Ideally, a person will walk away from that first interaction curious to learn what else the Book of Mormon contains. They will have the ability to request a personal copy or to meet with missionaries.  

##Possible Features:
-Share a quote to social media or save it to their phone
-Request book
-Meet missionaries
-Write reflective journal entries
