#FINAL EXAM AND MIDTERM NOTES


##PHASE ONE: SETTING EVERYTHING UP
-After handling a merge conflict, remember that you don't need to re "add" the file. Adding it
happened before committing. And committing was what caused the conflict. So after you edit out the 
merge conflict deliminators, you just need to recommit (adding a note about fixing the merge) and then push.
